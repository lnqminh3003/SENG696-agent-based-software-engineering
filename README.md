## Agents

1. User Agent: Gather input from the user (destination, dates, budget) and displays the final plan
2. Planner Agent: Act as the coordinator, receives user input, communicates with other agents, and constructs the top 3 best travel plans
3. Transport Agent: Provide available transport options (bus, train, flight) with associated costs
4. Hotel Agent: Suggest hotel options based on budget and destination
5. Payment Agent: Simulates the payment process and confirms the booking
